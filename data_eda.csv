IZEA is looking for a Data Engineer to join our Core Technology group in Winter Park, FL.

You will use the latest tools and technology to build and support IZEA's industry-leading data initiatives.

You will have direct access to end-users and stakeholders, and you are encouraged to build and leverage these relationships in your work. You will write and test your code, and work with our QA team to get it deployed to production. With the help of a homegrown, bot-driven CI/CD pipeline, your code will be delivered to users daily. This cross-functional team leverages Amazon Web Services for everything from ECS for containerized virtualization and hosting, to S3 for durable object storage, RDS and DynamoDB for persistence, EMR for the batch processing of billions of records, and Lambda for distributed workloads and stream consumption.

Aside from the day to day, we can offer you incredible benefits including an annual continuing education budget, a trust-focused development process, a flexible and collaborative work environment where balance matters, stock ownership, and an annual company retreat.

The team strives to be ego-free and motivated only by building amazing software for our users. We seek to understand the ""why"" behind the ""what"". We regularly break out into small teams to tackle problems, learn new technologies, or just share what we know with others. We test our code and invest in the health of our systems. We push each other, learn from each other, and strive to continually grow.

Primary Responsibilities

You will...
Work with stakeholders to define the solutions to development problems and business requirements
Develop and maintain the features and capabilities of our data ingestion pipelines
Extract actionable and impactful insights from vast amounts of data
Develop and maintain the services that surface those insights and make them available for consumption in a performant manner
Create unit and integration tests for your code
Reproduce and fix bugs reported by internal and external users
Set goals and communicate often about your progress toward them
Contribute to the ongoing improvement of the engineering organization and our software

What We’re Looking For

A problem solver at heart
Much of our work revolves around problems that have no existing off-the-shelf solution or consensus on best practices. You'll often need to break down large problems into smaller more manageable tasks and utilize critical thinking to come up with novel ideas.

3+ years of engineering experience
Things move quickly in the data group. You’ll need to be comfortable and familiar with delivering highly scalable cloud based applications.

Professional experience with frameworks like Hadoop, Spark, or similar
This will be a significant component of your responsibilities. You will be working with large data sets in a distributed environment on a daily basis. Familiarity w/ the Hadoop/Spark ecosystem is a must.

Professional experience with Python data tools
Our data team uses PySpark and Jupyter notebooks extensively. Familiarity with these technologies will also serve you well.

Direct experience with relational and NoSQL databases technologies
We use the best tool for the job around here. When it comes to storing and accessing data, we recognize that the technology decisions we make directly impact our ability to provide a performant customer experience, and our own costs.

Experience designing and building JSON based RESTful APIs
Because we are building our application with a front end framework, we carefully design and document the APIs to power it. To help us, we follow the JSON API spec, but any experience in building a RESTful API will be useful. Remember, the API is your contract with the consumers of your data!

Understanding of monolithic and micro-service based architectures
IZEAx still has some legacy monolithic characteristics. We move more and more of our technology to a distributed set of services, there are new challenges to overcome. Understanding the differences between these two models will help you take those challenges head on.

Basic Linux skills
In order to develop our data pipelines and services, you need to run it on your laptop. This means opening up some terminal windows, running some commands, and keeping the log output open. Additionally, some of our technology stack is better accessed through CLIs. Examples include the Ember CLI, the Rails CLI/console, Docker commands, Gradle, and our own CLIs. We'll walk you through it, but you should be comfy in a terminal.

Ability to multitask and prioritize multiple incoming requests
IZEA's Engineering team strives to provide a great experience and great service to our users. In order to do that, you may need to context switch into a support issue or drop what you are doing to start work on something else. This is part of what Agile means to us.

Excellent verbal and written communications skills
Regular and timely communication is the key to a trust based development process. You should be able to simply and concisely ask for feedback and direction in terms that your audience understands, and relay requested information in a timely fashion to your leaders. You should prioritize documentation of processes and code.

Demonstrated experience with the following will be highly valued

Data Science Background
While not required, a fundamental understanding of statistics and modeling would be a great asset. Practical experience with Machine Learning and/or complex data pipelines would also be welcome.

Front End development experience
From time to time you may need to build visualization, or (lite) user facing experiences. Familiarity with modern web frameworks like Angular, React, Ember, or Vue would be helpful. Extra bonus points if you have familiarity w/ Javascript based visualization libraries like d3.js or Highcharts.

Amazon Web Services, or other cloud providers
IZEA's software is hosted on AWS, and you will need to acquire some familiarity with it. Previous experience in using a cloud provider, even if just for developer tooling, shows that you understand some of the nuances involved in working in the cloud. Familiarity with Amazon’s EMR would also be an asset.

Continuous Integration & Deployment
IZEA needs to get features and fixes out to customers as soon as we possibly can with as much confidence as possible. To facilitate this, we have developed a CI/CD pipeline (using 3rd party services). An understanding of what CI/CD is will help you understand how this pipeline works and how to make it even better.

GitHub
All of IZEA's code is source controlled on Github. We leverage Github Pull Requests for code reviews, Github integrations manage parts of our CI/CD pipeline, and Github releases define the code tags that ultimately get deployed. Much of our process documentation exists on Github pages. Familiarity with navigating Github's features will help you ramp up in our SDLC faster.

JIRA
IZEA uses JIRA to manage projects and report on progress to stakeholders inside and outside the company. While we strive to automate as much of JIRA as possible with bots, webhooks and reports, understanding how JIRA issues, links, attachments, and workflows work will help you understand our SDLC faster.

About IZEA:

We are IZEA: The Creator Marketplace. Our cloud-based technologies connect Brands and Publishers with content Creators who blog, tweet, pin, and post on their behalf.

Our driving belief is that the only way to thrive in our rapidly changing world is to change ahead of it. IZEA is in a constant state of evolution and reinvention. While we may have invented the industry, we still operate like an entrepreneurial, scrappy start-up. Your time here will be exciting, educational, and at times, a bit crazy.

With IZEA, you have the opportunity to join a non-traditional corporate culture, where creativity and productivity are valued over a suit and tie. We call it ""The IZEA Way.""


Why would you want to work here?

Our developers use the latest tools and technology to build the applications and services that make up the IZEA Exchange platform. We write in whatever language we need to get the job done including Ruby, Java, Python, PHP, Swift, and Javascript. We leverage the latest frameworks, such as Rails, Symphony2, and Drop Wizard for iterating quickly on our technology.

Our code is deployed and operated by the people who write it, with the help of Amazon Web Services. We leverage everything from EC2 for virtualization and hosting, to Amazon EMR and Machine Learning for advanced analytics.

Aside from the day to day, we offer incredible benefits including an annual continuing education budget, a flexible trust-focused development process, and an open collaborative work environment.

Our team is ego-free and motivated to build great software. We regularly break out into small teams to tackle problems, learn new technologies, or just share what we know with others. We test our code and invest in the health of our systems. We push each other, learn from each other, and strive to continually grow as a team.

You have experience with relational databases such as PostgreSQL, Oracle or SQL Server, and maybe even Hadoop, Hive, Spark or Redshift.
You strive to learn the newest and greatest techniques where BERT/ELMo are not just Sesame Street© characters.
What you’ll own
The foundation for advanced analytics at a global company.
The roadmap of projects you’ll work on that tie directly to business goals and objectives.
Manage the entire lifecycle of data projects from strategic planning to tactical activities (data collection, cleanup, analysis, model implementation).
Sourcing new data for a firm that rarely scrapes, pulls or pushes.
Facilitate communication throughout the development process between executive stakeholders, your users and technical teams.

The team strives to be ego-free and motivated only by building amazing software for our users. We seek to understand the ""why"" behind the ""what"". We regularly break out into small teams to tackle problems, learn new technologies, or just share what we know with others. We test our code and invest in the health of our systems. We push each other, learn from each other, and strive to continually grow.

Primary Responsibilities

You will...
Work with stakeholders to define the solutions to development problems and business requirements
Develop and maintain the features and capabilities of our data ingestion pipelines
Extract actionable and impactful insights from vast amounts of data
Develop and maintain the services that surface those insights and make them available for consumption in a performant manner
Create unit and integration tests for your code
Reproduce and fix bugs reported by internal and external users
Set goals and communicate often about your progress toward them
Contribute to the ongoing improvement of the engineering organization and our software

What We’re Looking For

A problem solver at heart
Much of our work revolves around problems that have no existing off-the-shelf solution or consensus on best practices. You'll often need to break down large problems into smaller more manageable tasks and utilize critical thinking to come up with novel ideas.

3+ years of engineering experience
Things move quickly in the data group. You’ll need to be comfortable and familiar with delivering highly scalable cloud based applications.

Professional experience with frameworks like Hadoop, Spark, or similar
This will be a significant component of your responsibilities. You will be working with large data sets in a distributed environment on a daily basis. Familiarity w/ the Hadoop/Spark ecosystem is a must.

Professional experience with Python data tools
Our data team uses PySpark and Jupyter notebooks extensively. Familiarity with these technologies will also serve you well.

Direct experience with relational and NoSQL databases technologies
We use the best tool for the job around here. When it comes to storing and accessing data, we recognize that the technology decisions we make directly impact our ability to provide a performant customer experience, and our own costs.

Experience designing and building JSON based RESTful APIs
Because we are building our application with a front end framework, we carefully design and document the APIs to power it. To help us, we follow the JSON API spec, but any experience in building a RESTful API will be useful. Remember, the API is your contract with the consumers of your data!

Understanding of monolithic and micro-service based architectures
IZEAx still has some legacy monolithic characteristics. We move more and more of our technology to a distributed set of services, there are new challenges to overcome. Understanding the differences between these two models will help you take those challenges head on.

Basic Linux skills
In order to develop our data pipelines and services, you need to run it on your laptop. This means opening up some terminal windows, running some commands, and keeping the log output open. Additionally, some of our technology stack is better accessed through CLIs. Examples include the Ember CLI, the Rails CLI/console, Docker commands, Gradle, and our own CLIs. We'll walk you through it, but you should be comfy in a terminal.

Ability to multitask and prioritize multiple incoming requests
IZEA's Engineering team strives to provide a great experience and great service to our users. In order to do that, you may need to context switch into a support issue or drop what you are doing to start work on something else. This is part of what Agile means to us.

Excellent verbal and written communications skills
Regular and timely communication is the key to a trust based development process. You should be able to simply and concisely ask for feedback and direction in terms that your audience understands, and relay requested information in a timely fashion to your leaders. You should prioritize documentation of processes and code.

Demonstrated experience with the following will be highly valued

Data Science Background
While not required, a fundamental understanding of statistics and modeling would be a great asset. Practical experience with Machine Learning and/or complex data pipelines would also be welcome.

Front End development experience
From time to time you may need to build visualization, or (lite) user facing experiences. Familiarity with modern web frameworks like Angular, React, Ember, or Vue would be helpful. Extra bonus points if you have familiarity w/ Javascript based visualization libraries like d3.js or Highcharts.

Amazon Web Services, or other cloud providers
IZEA's software is hosted on AWS, and you will need to acquire some familiarity with it. Previous experience in using a cloud provider, even if just for developer tooling, shows that you understand some of the nuances involved in working in the cloud. Familiarity with Amazon’s EMR would also be an asset.

Continuous Integration & Deployment
IZEA needs to get features and fixes out to customers as soon as we possibly can with as much confidence as possible. To facilitate this, we have developed a CI/CD pipeline (using 3rd party services). An understanding of what CI/CD is will help you understand how this pipeline works and how to make it even better.

GitHub
All of IZEA's code is source controlled on Github. We leverage Github Pull Requests for code reviews, Github integrations manage parts of our CI/CD pipeline, and Github releases define the code tags that ultimately get deployed. Much of our process documentation exists on Github pages. Familiarity with navigating Github's features will help you ramp up in our SDLC faster.

JIRA
IZEA uses JIRA to manage projects and report on progress to stakeholders inside and outside the company. While we strive to automate as much of JIRA as possible with bots, webhooks and reports, understanding how JIRA issues, links, attachments, and workflows work will help you understand our SDLC faster.

About IZEA:

We are IZEA: The Creator Marketplace. Our cloud-based technologies connect Brands and Publishers with content Creators who blog, tweet, pin, and post on their behalf.

Our driving belief is that the only way to thrive in our rapidly changing world is to change ahead of it. IZEA is in a constant state of evolution and reinvention. While we may have invented the industry, we still operate like an entrepreneurial, scrappy start-up. Your time here will be exciting, educational, and at times, a bit crazy.

With IZEA, you have the opportunity to join a non-traditional corporate culture, where creativity and productivity are valued over a suit and tie. We call it ""The IZEA Way.""


Why would you want to work here?

Our developers use the latest tools and technology to build the applications and services that make up the IZEA Exchange platform. We write in whatever language we need to get the job done including Ruby, Java, Python, PHP, Swift, and Javascript. We leverage the latest frameworks, such as Rails, Symphony2, and Drop Wizard for iterating quickly on our technology.

Our code is deployed and operated by the people who write it, with the help of Amazon Web Services. We leverage everything from EC2 for virtualization and hosting, to Amazon EMR and Machine Learning for advanced analytics.

Aside from the day to day, we offer incredible benefits including an annual continuing education budget, a flexible trust-focused development process, and an open collaborative work environment.

Our team is ego-free and motivated to build great software. We regularly break out into small teams to tackle problems, learn new technologies, or just share what we know with others. We test our code and invest in the health of our systems. We push each other, learn from each other, and strive to continually grow as a team.

Self-aware, almost to a fault, SEI consultants keenly understand how to adjust their approach based on the situation.

SEI Consultants define ambition differently. SEI Consultants are authentic, low-maintenance individuals who like to hang out with colleagues outside of work. Whether it be cooking, traveling, hiking, or volunteering, SEI Consultants enjoy working with genuine, thoughtful folks who want to steer clear of the traditional grind and share the joy of day-to-day life and activities with colleagues, friends and family.

We all know someone who’s been affected by cancer, and we’ve proven that our technology can help get life-saving treatments to patients faster (https://people.com/health/teacher-brain-tumor-week-to-live-now-thriving/). Having already signed a set of Fortune 500 paying clients, we’re ramping up for our next phase of growth and are looking for a bold and self-motivated engineer to join us as we change healthcare for the better.

More about us:

Currently developing a single new drug can take over $1B and 15 years, with over 99% of drugs failing along the way. This is why over 70% of all known diseases have no treatments and millions of patients are left with no viable treatment options.

At OneThree Biotech we’re working to change this using biology-driven AI. Founded after members of our team lost family members to rare cancer, the team at OneThree has spent the last 5+ years researching how we can combine AI with systems biology to stop this from happening to anyone else. We’re building a platform to not only predict new potential therapeutics, but also to pinpoint the mechanisms driving efficacy, and we pride ourselves on building a new form of biology-driven AI that values interpretability as much as accuracy. After raising a multi-million round of funding, we’re looking for a Lead Data Engineer to join our interdisciplinary team as we look to ramp up external partnerships and internal development.

Engage through more human experiences
As a Senior Data Engineer, you will report to the Head of Data and work closely with other members of the Data team to maintain and improve data pipelines, deploy predictive models as a service, and work on our data infrastructure.

Team Philosophy:
We believe that data engineers should not write ETL, unless data pipelines are necessary to support the services that we build and maintain. Instead, your time is better spent writing tooling and creating abstractions to support the work of analysts and data scientists on the team, so that other users in the company can write and maintain their own ETL.
Everyone on the team is considered and treated as a Senior, so you are given a lot of ownership over the projects you're working on. With this in mind, we expect you to write code that is well tested, modular, and maintainable. We frown at instances of destructive fire fighting, caused by badly designed architecture or mismanaged projects.
We like learners. Hence, we create an environment where Data Scientists learn the skills and abstraction patterns of Software Engineers and Data Engineers learn the iterative model development workflow seen in Machine Learning. Expect an environment where you will be constantly learning and challenged to interact with tools, languages, frameworks that are outside of your area of expertise.
Tools, Frameworks, and Languages you will work with:

Compute: Spark, Athena, EC2
Workflow Management: Airflow
Infrastructure: Terraform, Kubernetes
Potential Projects:
Deploy trained machine learning models as a Python microservice.
Help migrate legacy ETLs into Airflow
Write tooling to make ETL accessible to engineers on other teams.
Ideal background and expertise:
5+ years of experience as a full-time professional data engineer
Experience with server-side concepts, e.g. microservices, database, caching, performance, monitoring and scalability
3+ years of experience with Python or Scala
Working experience with OLTP databases such as Postgres, MySQL
Extensive experience making data available in OLAP databases such as Redshift or Snowflake
Experience with orchestration tools such as Airflow (preferred), Luigi, Ooozie
Nice to Have:
Familiarity with Business Intelligence tools such as Tableau, Looker, Superset

We use technology, data, and design to:
Build more affordable products
Deliver them to more people
Engage through more human experiences
As a Senior Data Engineer, you will report to the Head of Data and work closely with other members of the Data team to maintain and improve data pipelines, deploy predictive models as a service, and work on our data infrastructure.

Team Philosophy:
We believe that data engineers should not write ETL, unless data pipelines are necessary to support the services that we build and maintain. Instead, your time is better spent writing tooling and creating abstractions to support the work of analysts and data scientists on the team, so that other users in the company can write and maintain their own ETL.
Everyone on the team is considered and treated as a Senior, so you are given a lot of ownership over the projects you're working on. With this in mind, we expect you to write code that is well tested, modular, and maintainable. We frown at instances of destructive fire fighting, caused by badly designed architecture or mismanaged projects.
We like learners. Hence, we create an environment where Data Scientists learn the skills and abstraction patterns of Software Engineers and Data Engineers learn the iterative model development workflow seen in Machine Learning. Expect an environment where you will be constantly learning and challenged to interact with tools, languages, frameworks that are outside of your area of expertise.
Tools, Frameworks, and Languages you will work with:
Languages: Python, Scala, and occasionally R and Node.js
Storage: Postgres, Redshift, S3
Compute: Spark, Athena, EC2
Workflow Management: Airflow
Infrastructure: Terraform, Kubernetes
Potential Projects:
Deploy trained machine learning models as a Python microservice.
Help migrate legacy ETLs into Airflow
Write tooling to make ETL accessible to engineers on other teams.
Ideal background and expertise:
5+ years of experience as a full-time professional data engineer
Experience with server-side concepts, e.g. microservices, database, caching, performance, monitoring and scalability
3+ years of experience with Python or Scala
Working experience with OLTP databases such as Postgres, MySQL
Extensive experience making data available in OLAP databases such as Redshift or Snowflake
Experience with orchestration tools such as Airflow (preferred), Luigi, Ooozie
Nice to Have:
Familiarity with Business Intelligence tools such as Tableau, Looker, Superset
Domain experience developing software for Fintech, Banking, or related Consumer Financial Services companies

"Principal Scientist, ESB, Rare Diseases",$123K-$139K (Glassdoor est.),"ROLE SUMMARY

Pfizer is making significant investment in the creation of novel, first-in-class therapeutics, by combining internal discovery and validation of drug targets with external partnerships to produce clinical drug candidates for the Pfizer pipeline. This position is within a newly created Emerging Sciences Biology (ESB) group within Target Sciences (TS). Target Sciences has expertise in human genetics, functional genomics, automated analytic capabilities and data management, and target validation biology. Target Sciences works together with Pfizer’s Centers for Therapeutic Innovation (CTI) within Pfizer broader External Science & Innovation group to deliver a broad and deep pipeline of drug candidates, based on emerging science in the academic world.

The primary responsibility of the newly created Emerging Science Biology team is to play a driving role in addressing the critical task, identified as a gap, of rejuvenating the WRD pipeline with innovative, differentiated First-In-Class/ Only-In-Class programs in the years to come. This will be addressed by generation of strong data packages from target hypotheses derived from academic outreach and initiatives incl. ITENs, from human genetics, functional genomics and data mining to enable the initiation of new CTI and RU projects.

This position requires deep expertise in human rare diseases, a proven track record in managing target discovery and validation projects in a drug discovery setting, capability to execute, strong leadership skills, and the ability to network effectively at both a senior and hand- on level with CTI and RU biologists and Partner line scientists as well as with external academic PIs.

ROLE RESPONSIBILITIES

Key Deliverable:

o Leads scientific activities and projects for the design and execution of target validation studies defining confidence-in-rationale for potential drug targets and the pathway to pursue them in partnership with TS, CTI, Research Units, and Partner Line colleagues and external academics. This will include oversight of experimental work and 30-50% of time with hands-on experimentation.

o Establish strong data sets enabling objective decision making on specific prospective targets. Target candidates are discovered primarily through the hypothesis generation engine of Target Sciences but could also come from other sources.

o Collaborate successfully within a dynamic and agile group within the broader External Science and Innovation departmental structure and key partners to produce target packages for first-in-class drug discovery programs.

o While the primary responsibility will be to execute target validation plans to drive portfolio entry, it is expected that the incumbent to this role has high scientific and ethical standards and will produce outstanding work that will result in publication in top journals.

QUALIFICATIONS

o PhD and 4+ years’ experience in molecular biology, genomics and/or pharmacology or a closely related discipline.

o 2-4 years’ industrial experience using genomic, molecular, cellular, and/or biochemical technologies to drive drug discovery in a pharmaceutical / biotech setting is highly preferred.

o Deep knowledge and hands-on experience in DNA damage repair/response and human disease biology mechanism, with a strong preference for rare diseases.

o Strong track record of basic biology mechanistic research ideally demonstrated in the context of leading target discovery and validation projects and reflected in a strong record of achievement in peer-reviewed publications.

o Overseeing or experience from collaborations with CRO, external academic and biotech resources is a plus.

o Excellent leadership, collaboration, communication, and organizational skills, and ability and desire to work as part of a team dedicated to innovation.

Bioinformatics Research Scientist-Gene Regulation,$84K-$104K (Glassdoor est.),"Overview


St. Jude Childrens Research Hospital is seeking multiple Bioinformatics Research Scientists to study the role of genome and other nuclear organization in pediatric cancers. Recognized for state-of-the-art computational infrastructure, well-established analytical pipelines, and deep genomic analysis expertise, St. Jude offers a work environment where you will directly impact the care of pediatric cancer patients. As a Bioinformatics Research Scientist, your responsibilities include analyzing data generated from a variety of second- and third-generation sequencing applications that interrogate a broad range of human gene regulatory biology.

The Abraham lab studies gene expression-regulation mechanisms in healthy and diseased mammalian cells. We are recruiting computational biologists to collaboratively develop computational tools and frameworks to analyze high-throughput sequencing (-omics) data. We build analytical software pipelines to find answers to biological questions about gene regulation in big datasets, usually from applied sequencing experiments like ChIP-Seq, RNA-Seq, and Hi-ChIP. Our interests center on enhancers and super-enhancers. Specifically, we seek to understand how these regulatory elements establish gene expression programs in healthy cells, and how enhancers are altered by mutation, abused by mistargeting, and targetable with drugs in diseased cells. We focus on characterizing the core regulatory circuitries driving disease-relevant cells, and on understanding how mutations in the non-coding DNA of such cells can drive disease, including cancers, through gene misregulation.

The successful candidate will become a fundamental component of a multidisciplinary, inter-institutional team assembled to study how genome structures meaningfully differ between normal and pediatric cancer cells.

Ideal candidates will have experience building, tailoring, and deploying analysis pipelines using widely available genomic analysis toolkits (e.g. bedtools, samtools), as well as experience managing large numbers of datasets. The successful candidate will be tasked with collaborative research within and beyond the lab, so strong communication and interpersonal skills are essential. Additional experience in fundamental understanding of gene expression mechanisms (e.g. transcription factors, enhancers, genome structure, and transcriptional condensates), and experience building succinct, clear figures using R are preferred.

The department of Computational Biology provides access to high performance computing clusters, cloud computing environment, innovative visualization tools, highly automated analytical pipelines and mentorship from faculty scientists with experience in data analysis, data management and delivery of high-quality results for competitive projects. We encourage first author, high profile publications to share this element of discovery. Take the first step to join our team by applying now!
